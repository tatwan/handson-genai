# SVM

In this activity, you'll apply a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict if an office space is occupied for the purpose of energy conservation in buildings.

## Instructions

* Use the starter files [Stu_SVM.ipynb](Unsolved/Stu_SVM.ipynb) and [occupancy.csv](Resources/occupancy.csv) for this activity.

* Import a support vector machine linear classifier, and fit the model to the data.

* Compute the classification report for this model by using the testing data.
